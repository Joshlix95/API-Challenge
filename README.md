API-Challenge
=============
# Author: Josuel Musambaghani

Coding have been my top leisure and hobbie during my teenage.
Initially started while preparing my challenge to apply to CODE2040, I have since decided to switch my goal from a simple preparation of a challenge to a repository that helps to understand the basic concepts of APIs.

I understand the burden of this responsibility and the diversity of notions about APIs, but under a mentorship of informed sources and a strong creativity, my daily performances and contributions to this repository will make it an outstanding material to internalize notions about how APIs work. 

Keep connected and do not forget to come back for updates. 

Peace,
